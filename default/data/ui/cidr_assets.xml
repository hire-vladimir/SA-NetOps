          Introduction

        <p>
          This feature is designed to help users identify assets by subnet mask. Most users cannot easily convert subnets to CIDRs withouth some python tool or external scripts.
          The application ships with sample lookup files and blank template lookup files for the user to populate. Using a similiar syntax below, the customer can delineate subnets in an automatic lookup to run against all data sources.
          An automatic lookup is preferred because it helps to indentify netwrok traffic trends in various logs. For example, infected assets in a DMZ subnet may not be as high of a priority as infected assets in a PCI subnet. 
          <br/>

        <h1>
          Creating the automatic lookup:
        </h1>
        <p>This is an example search for creating the sample_cidr_network lookup. You should update the vlan_inventory lookup with your specific network information.</p>
examples:
<pre data-language="splunk">
sample search: | inputlookup sample_vlan_inventory | lookup subnet_to_cidr subnet_mask OUTPUT cidr, binary_mask, host_count, usable_hosts | eval cidr_address= network+cidr | outputlookup sample_cidr_network

production search: | inputlookup vlan_inventory | lookup subnet_to_cidr subnet_mask OUTPUT cidr, binary_mask, host_count, usable_hosts | eval cidr_address= network+cidr  | outputlookup cidr_network
</pre>
<br/>
<p>Once the cidr_network lookup has been created Splunk will create the following fields automagically:</p>
<pre>
network
physical_address
priority
remarks
segment
subnet_mask
zone
          
# Other fields you can add:
# lat
# lon
# cidr_address
# usable_hosts
# binary_mask
          
Alternatively, you can override these to prefix them with src_ or dest_ by overriding props.conf in local.
          
LOOKUP-subnet-intelligence_src = cidr_network cidr_address AS src_ip OUTPUT network AS src_network physical_address AS src_physical_address priority AS src_priority remarks AS src_remarks segment AS src_segment subnet_mask AS src_subnet_mask zone AS src_zone

LOOKUP-subnet-intelligence_dest = cidr_network cidr_address AS dest_ip OUTPUT network AS dest_network physical_address AS dest_physical_address priority AS dest_priority remarks AS dest_remarks segment AS dest_segment subnet_mask AS dest_subnet_mask zone AS dest_zone
